# Mermaid System Scenario
  You are designing a system that needs to:
  * A User created a new object: I need to mint a ID with ID System X
  * A User updates the metadata on the Object: Update Sytem X if the change is something X is interested
  * The system notifies curator when an object is ready for review
  * A Curator needs to approve the object for it to show up publically in the system
  * A User can revoke an object at any time: Need to revoke System X ID

## Questions:
  * What types of user do we have in the system?
  * What are the states an object can go through?
  * What systems do we need to interact with?

## What type of diagrams help us to answer the above questions?
  * flow diagram
  * State diagram
  * Interaction diagram
