# Talk Outline

## Example Mermaid Diagrams
  **Will change diagrams to more complex eaxmples**
  * [State Diagram](https://github.com/pulibrary/pdc_describe/blob/main/docs/work_states.md)
  * [Flow Diagram](https://github.com/pulibrary/lib_jobs/tree/main/docs/peoplesoft_voucher)
  * [System Interaction Digram](https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/blob/main/docs/request_form_diagram.md)

## System Scenario
  [see Scenario](https://github.com/carolyncole/i_love_mermaid/edit/main/scenario.md)
  
  What would a diagram(s) help me with?
  * Verifing my understaning of the requirements
    * A diagram that reflects the requirements to the stakeholders is a low impact way of validating understanding.
  * Document the system for future developers (including yourself)
    * Future developers do not need to read the entire set of requirements to get an idea of what the system does
  * understand how the requirements interact and help to expose implicit requirements

## Questions I might ask given the scenario above:
  * What types of user do we have in the system?
  * What are the states an object can go through?
  * What systems do we need to interact with?

### What type of diagrams would help us to answer the above questions?
  * [Flow diagram] (https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/sequenceDiagram)
  * State diagram
  * Interaction diagram

## Lets build a flow diagram
  1. Start with an Empty Diagram
  1. Add in the Actors
  1. Add in the Steps and system reactions

## Why mermaid is so great!  Lets add a requirement
   The system should notify the user when an administrator approves the object.

## Style the Diagram
  Colors can draw your attention and add clarity
