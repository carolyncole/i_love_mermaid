Mermaid System Scenario
You are designing a system that needs to:

* A User created a new object: I need to mint a ID with ID System X
* A User updates the metadata on the Object: Update Sytem X if the change is something X is interested
* The system notifies curator when an object is ready for review
* A Curator needs to approve the object for it to show up publically in the system
* A User can revoke an object at any time: Need to revoke System X ID
